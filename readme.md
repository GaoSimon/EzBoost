This project is the implementation of 《EzBoost: Fast And Secure Vertical Federated Tree Boosting Framework via EzPC》.

PureBoost is a vertical federated learning framework based on XGBoost that we implemented in C++ for comparison purposes, and it does not implement privacy protection for the data.

EzBoost is implemented in C++ and is the main design framework in our paper. It combines EzPC and XGBoost to achieve a more efficient privacy-preserving vertical federated boosting tree framework.

SGBoost is the framework in the paper "SGBoost: An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Vertical Federated Tree Boosting Framework". We took the jar file from https://github.com/nds2022/SGBoost and decompiled it into executable code.
